## 2026-09-14 — Vercel deploy backfilled into the record; docs reconciled to match (session 6)

**Milestone:** M1
**Tasks:** doc-only pass across `decisions.md`, `CONTRACT.md`, `README.md`, `BRIEF.md`, `architecture.md`, `tasks.md`; plus `layout.tsx` metadata, fonts, and `lib/tokens.ts`
**Model/tool:** Claude Code

**Done:**
- **Backfilling an undocumented event:** at some point before this session, the site moved off the specced Cloudflare Pages architecture and was deployed to Vercel after fixing a Root Directory / Framework Preset misconfiguration in the Vercel project settings. It has been live since at `https://qff-2026-site.vercel.app`, but nothing in this repo recorded that it happened — `AGENT_LOG.md`, `CONTRACT.md`'s `PROD_URL`, `README.md` and `architecture.md` all still described the original Cloudflare plan. This entry is that missing record.
- Most of M1 is confirmed live on the production URL: sections 01–10 (Hero, About, Decade, Myths, Sessions, Speakers, Schedule, FAQ, Checklist, Venue) all render, verified by fetching the live page directly rather than trusting the spec.
- Recorded the move as **D-013**: stated plainly as a practical migration during build, not a reasoned decision, with the registration backend (D1 vs. something Vercel-native) still unresolved — see D-002.
- Reconciled the rest of the spec to match: `PROD_URL` in `CONTRACT.md`, the live-site line and Stack section in `README.md`, `BRIEF.md`'s "Where things stand," and `architecture.md` §1/§3 marked superseded pending the backend decision (without deleting the original Cloudflare/D1 design — it's still what M2 would build if the backend decision lands that way).
- Reconciled `spec/tasks.md` against actual repo files and the live site rather than trusting prior commit messages (see Noticed below on why that mattered). Checked off M1-CONTENT-03/M1-UI-03 (Sessions) and M1-CONTENT-07/M1-UI-07 (Speakers), plus several already-satisfied M0-SETUP/M0-UI items.
- Fixed the two open bugs named as still-outstanding going into this session: the homepage meta description was generic ("celebrating technology, creativity, innovation, and campus culture...") and now describes the actual event; and the font/colour tokens from M0-FIX-02/M0-FIX-03 were still unapplied (Geist/Inter instead of Plex, hand-written CSS vars instead of `lib/tokens.ts`) and are now fixed — see the code changes below.
- Registration remains intentionally incomplete: a page exists (`app/register/page.tsx`) with a working-looking form, but the backend is deliberately paused pending the D-002 database decision, per this session's explicit boundary. See Noticed below for what "incomplete" currently means in practice.

**Not finished:**
- The registration backend decision (D-002) itself — this session only documented that it's still open, which is the actual blocker behind almost everything else in Noticed below.
- `M0-SETUP-02` (`.env.example`) and the `output: 'export'` half of `M0-SETUP-04` — both still missing, previously miscredited as done (see Noticed).
- Brand asset checksums for INV-9-T (`M0-SETUP-06`).

**Noticed but not fixed (found while reconciling docs, not in the original task list):**
- **`qff_2026/app/api/register/route.ts` logs the full registration payload via `console.log("Server: ", data)`** — a direct INV-3 violation (personal data in logs) — and doesn't write to any store at all; it just echoes the payload back with a fake 201 "Registration successful", which is an INV-1 violation (a success state with no durable row). This is inside the BOUNDARY this session was told not to touch, so it was not fixed, only flagged. It needs attention before anyone actually submits the form.
- The registration path is a Next.js API route, a shape `architecture.md` §4 marks **not supported** and D-004 rejected outright for a static-export site. It only works because the site is now on Vercel (D-013). D-001's rejection of Vercel Hobby was never revisited before the move.
- `next.config.ts` has no `output: 'export'` and the project is on Next.js 16.3.4, not the pinned 15.x — neither matches `architecture.md` §1 as written. Left as-is; this is entangled with the same backend/hosting decision as the API route above, not something to silently "fix" back to static export while a live API route depends on a Node runtime.
- Commit `f5175c6`'s message claims M0-SETUP-02 (`.env.example`) and part of M0-SETUP-04 (static export) were fixed; the actual diff touched neither. Treat AGENT_LOG-adjacent commit messages as unverified until checked against the diff — this is the second time in this repo's history a claimed fix wasn't real (see the 2026-09-05 entry on treating AI-generated content as unreviewed).
- `content/speakers.ts` ships an explicit placeholder speaker (`"Speaker Name TBA"`, `isPlaceholder: true`) live in production, which is exactly what M1-CONTENT-07's own acceptance criteria and `AGENTS.md` §4 say not to do. Checked off in `tasks.md` as "built and live" per this session's instructions, but flagged there as not actually meeting its acceptance bar.
- Brand asset checksums (`M0-SETUP-06`, INV-9-T) were never recorded in `spec/evals.md` §3 — still the unfilled placeholder table.
- `Hero.tsx` uses `text-destructive` purely as a decorative accent colour for the event date, not for an error state. Remapping `--destructive` to a real warning colour (this session) changes that highlight's colour as a side effect. Not fixed here since `Hero.tsx` wasn't in scope for this pass — whoever owns that section should swap it to an accent token instead.

**Next action:** Resolve D-002 (registration backend) — everything downstream (the fake API route, the Cloudflare/Vercel architecture mismatch, `next.config.ts`) is blocked on that one decision.

## 2026-09-08 — Reorder landing sections sequentially & fix brand alt typo (session 5)

**Milestone:** M1
**Tasks:** Section layout ordering & polish
**Model/tool:** Antigravity

**Done:**
- Fixed typo in Hero section image alt attribute from `Qskit` to `Qiskit`.
- Reordered landing page sections in `app/page.tsx` sequentially: Hero (01), About (02), Decade (03), Myths (04), Sessions (05), Speakers (06), Schedule (07), FAQ (08), Checklist (09), Venue (10).
- Renumbered SectionLabel tags from 1 to 10 sequentially (`SectionFaq` 08, `SectionChecklist` 09, `SectionVenue` 10).
- Verified clean build (`npm run build`) with Turbopack and static export.

**Not finished:**
- None for this task.

**Noticed but not fixed:**
- None.

**Next action:** Push branch to fork origin and open pull request.

## 2026-09-07 — Decade timeline & Myths interactive section built (session 4)

**Milestone:** M1
**Tasks:** `M1-CONTENT-01`, `M1-CONTENT-02`, `M1-UI-01`, `M1-UI-02`
**Model/tool:** Antigravity

**Done:**
- Created `qff_2026/content/decade.ts` with 11 sourced entries (2016–2026) comparing claimed vs achieved with verified metrics, concluding with QFF 2026 at MIT-ADT.
- Created `qff_2026/content/myths.ts` with 4 sourced claim/reality pairs covering superposition/interference, RSA factoring physical qubit requirements, BQP vs classical 5 GHz clocks, and NISQ error mitigation. Zero banned adjectives.
- Built `components/sections/Decade.tsx` (Section 03) featuring interactive year filtering, responsive card comparisons, milestone spine, and `SectionContainer` consistency.
- Built `components/sections/Myths.tsx` (Section 04) featuring real two-stage quantum measurement interaction with character/bit scrambling animation resolving into reality corrections, highlighted with `MAGENTA_40` / pink accents, guarded by `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Added required verbatim IBM attribution line to `components/sections/Footer.tsx` per `CONTRACT.md`.
- Integrated Section 03 (`Decade`) and Section 04 (`Myths`) into `app/page.tsx`.
- Verified clean build (`npm run build`) with zero TypeScript errors and successful static export.

**Not finished:**
- Remaining landing page sections (Schedule, Speakers, FAQ, Pre-event checklist) not yet wired.

**Noticed but not fixed:**
- Project Next.js root is in `qff_2026/` subdirectory while repo root contains specs and git config.

**Next action:** `M1-CONTENT-03` / `M1-UI-03` — Sessions section (Part 1 and Part 2 cards).

## 2026-09-05 — Mockup agreed, specs reconciled (session 3)

**Milestone:** pre-M0
**Tasks:** none — still no code
**Model/tool:** Claude (chat) + Claude Design

**Done:**
- Full 12-section visual mockup built and iterated in Claude Design; mobile 360px and desktop 1440px
- Myths section (04) built with a real two-stage interaction: "MEASURE →" scrambles bit-strings, then snaps to the correction. Better than the accordion originally specced
- Registration form settled: name, email, phone, college, year of study, session choice, laptop confirmation, required 18+ checkbox, optional mailing opt-in. Grouped YOUR DETAILS / ATTENDING / CONSENT with visible labels
- IBM Quantum Open Plan limits verified — 10 min per 28-day window, +180 min promo for active accounts, ibm_kingston (156q) available. `architecture.md` §8 no longer provisional
- Decade and myths content sourced against real figures; `#D02670` palette drift caught and fixed; "IBM's series of student-run events" copy error caught and fixed
- D-010 (partial attendance allowed) and D-011 (mockup is reference, not code) recorded
- `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` written for human contributors
- D1 schema updated to the final field set; `product.md` metric #3 rewritten since the IBM-account field was dropped from the form

**Not finished:**
- Repo not created, nothing deployed, no code written
- Speaker, venue, and coordinator email still placeholders

**Noticed but did not fix:**
- Speaker subtitle and bio in the mockup still read "Title — placeholder" and "One-line bio placeholder". Cosmetic; fix when the real speaker is confirmed
- Design tools drifted from the pinned palette once and invented a factual claim once, both caught only by review. Treat AI-generated content as unreviewed by default
- `PROD_URL` assumes `qff-2026-mitadt.pages.dev` is free — pages.dev subdomains are globally unique, confirm at project creation and update `CONTRACT.md` if taken

**Next action:** `M0-SETUP-01` — create the repo under github.com/qquestclub, add `.gitignore`, commit the spec system.

---

## 2026-09-04 — Spec system written (session 2)

**Milestone:** pre-M0
**Tasks:** none — no code written yet
**Model/tool:** Claude, chat

**Done:**
- Intake completed across product, constraints, correctness core, stack, data/privacy, delivery and risk
- Benchmarked the 2026 cohort: ~15 community sites from IBM's submission table. Median is a single scrolling page. Two are strong — QTC × USTHB Algiers (creative concept, a section built from the 2026 theme, own `/register` route currently stubbed) and DBATU Lonere (same state, 26–28 Oct, countdown, QR, attendee PDF, five-question FAQ, Airtable registration, DBATU-students-only)
- Design tokens extracted directly from the official deliverables rather than guessed: palette is IBM Carbon (`#31135E`, `#FF7EB6`, `#8B3FFC`, `#0F62FE`, …), typography is IBM Plex Sans + Plex Mono, confirmed in the official PPT template
- Wrote `CONTRACT.md` (10 invariants), `AGENTS.md`, `BRIEF.md`, and all seven `spec/` documents
- Nine decisions recorded, D-001 to D-009

**Not finished:**
- Repo not created; nothing deployed
- `content/` modules not written — this is M1 and it is the differentiator
- Brand asset checksums not yet recorded (blocked on `M0-SETUP-06`)

**Noticed but not fixed:**
- Team available hours per week never established — every estimate in `plan.md` assumes ~10 combined person-hours and should be re-checked after M0
- Venue room, speaker names beyond the IBM speaker, and whether virtual attendance is offered are all unknown. Marked provisional in `architecture.md` §9. Do not invent placeholders — this site is linked from IBM
- IBM Quantum Open Plan QPU limits not verified against current documentation. This is the binding constraint on Part 2 and on what the site may claim about hardware access
- One community in the cohort has submitted `http://127.0.0.1:4444/...` to IBM and another a Vercel branch-preview URL. Both permanently broken. This is why INV-7 exists

**Next action:** `M0-SETUP-01` — init the repo, add `.gitignore` covering `.env*`, commit the spec system as `chore: spec system and project skeleton`.

## 2026-09-07 - Task C: Practical Info (Completed)
Built and wired the FAQ, Checklist, Schedule, and Venue sections. Intervened to integrate \shadcn/ui\ Accordion for FAQ and a live Countdown timer per user request. Modified CTAs across Hero and Navbar to route to an interim \/register\ page which links to the placeholder Google Form. Verified zero errors and zero warnings on build.


## 2026-09-07 - Task C: Reverts
Per user request, reverted the live Countdown timer and the Registration page stub updates, leaving them as static stubs for another team member's tasks.


## 2026-09-07 - Task C: Reverts Reverted
Per user request, brought back the live Countdown timer and the Registration page stub updates.


## 2026-09-07 - Task C: Rewind
Executed /rewind per user request to definitively restore the static countdown and original Registration page stub.
